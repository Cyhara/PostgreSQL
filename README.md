# Project Overview

This project is a Node.js application that uses Express.js as the web framework and PostgreSQL as the database. It includes a basic setup for connecting to a PostgreSQL database, applying middlewares, and defining routes.

## File Structure

* `App.js`: The main entry point of the application. It sets up the Express.js server, applies middlewares, and defines routes.
* `dbConfig.js`: A file that exports a PostgreSQL database connection pool using the `pg` library.
* `middlewares/index.js`: A file that defines and exports middlewares for the application.
* `routes/userRoute.js`: A file that defines routes for user-related endpoints.
* `.gitignore`: A file that specifies files and directories to ignore in the Git repository.


## Endpoints

### GET /api/users

* Returns a list of all users in the database
* Example response:
```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "John Doe",
    "email": "john@example.com",
    "age": 30
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "name": "Jane Doe",
    "email": "jane@example.com",
    "age": 25
  }
]
GET /api/users/:id
Returns a single user by ID
Example request: GET /api/users/1
Example response:
JSON
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "John Doe",
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "age": 30
}

## POST /api/users
Creates a new user
Example request body:
JSON
{
  "name": "New User",
  "email": "new@example.com",
  "age": 35
}
Example response:
JSON
{
  "id": 3,
  "name": "New User",
  "email": "new@example.com",
  "age": 35
}

This updated README.md file includes specific examples for the /users and /users/:id functionality, making it easier for users to understand how to use the API.

## File Descriptions

### App.js

This file sets up the Express.js server, applies middlewares, and defines routes. It also establishes a connection to the PostgreSQL database and handles server termination.

### dbConfig.js

This file exports a PostgreSQL database connection pool using the `pg` library. It defines the database connection parameters and handles errors.

### middlewares/index.js

This file defines and exports middlewares for the application. Currently, it includes middlewares for parsing JSON and URL-encoded requests.

### routes/userRoutes.js

This file defines routes for user-related endpoints. It includes a basic example of a route that retrieves all users from the database.

### .gitignore

This file specifies files and directories to ignore in the Git repository. It includes the `node_modules` directory and the `dbConfig.js` file to prevent sensitive database credentials from being committed.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-repo/your-project.git`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Create a `dbConfig.js` file with your PostgreSQL database credentials
4. Start the server: `node index.js`
5. Access the application at `http://localhost:5000`

## Notes

* Make sure to replace the placeholders in `dbConfig.js` with your actual PostgreSQL database credentials.
* This is a basic example, and you should add more error handling and security measures depending on your specific use case.
